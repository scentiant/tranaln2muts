## tranaln2muts - list mutations observed in tranalign/ MRTRANS results

This repository describes a pipeline used to identify and tabulate synonymous, non-synonymous and indel mutations observed in CDS alignments guided by pre-existing, peptide-level MSAs. It depends on v3.8.1551 of the *MUSCLE* multiple sequence aligner and v6.6.0.0 of the EMBOSS software suite (in particular, the programs *seqret* and *tranalign*); these programs should be accessible via the user's $PATH. This software is provided "**AS IS**".
